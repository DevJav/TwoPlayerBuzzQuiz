# TWO PLAYER BUZZ QUIZ

This code starts as a simple script to use the Buzz controllers from the playstation to play a quiz game.

Right now is intended to be for two players, and only the red Buzz button is used. It manages who pressed first, and it can be configured to have a time limit to answer the questions and also rebounds if the answer is wrong or the time runs out.

The other controllers can be used to mark the answers as correct (Buzz button) or incorrect (the 4 answer buttons).
